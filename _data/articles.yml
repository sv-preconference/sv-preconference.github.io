  tags: "consent"
  abstract: "Preventing sexual assault is a core goal for universities as prevalence rates of sexual assault remain high, particularly among college students. A key mechanism thought to decrease rates of sexual assault is teaching college students how to give clear, explicit, verbal refusals. However, there is a paucity of research regarding how college students refuse sex. Thus, the purpose of this study was to understand different behavioral strategies college students would use to refuse sex. A sample of 773 heterosexual college students (523 women, 250 men) were recruited from two large southern universities in the USA to complete a survey on sexual  communication.  Thirty-eight  items  assessing  verbal  and behavioral cues that college students would use to refuse vaginal–penile sex were written based on previous, formative research. Items were assessed by the research team through an exploratory factor analyses, followed by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The  results  yielded  a  three-factor  structure:  direct  nonverbal refusals,  direct  verbal refusals,  and  indirect  nonverbal  refusals; CFA results suggested a good fit index for the model. Two independent sample t tests were conducted to examine differences in refusal cues across gender and relationship status; significant differences in refusals  emerged  for  both.  The  three-factor  structure  depicting refusal cues was similar to previous work depicting cues college students use to communicate sexual consent; such information could inform sexual assault prevention programming."

  tags: "condom use, hostility, alcohol, reproductive coercion"
  abstract: "The aim of this study was to extend previous research demonstrating that intoxicated men high in hostility toward women report stronger intentions to use coercive condom use resistance (CUR) tactics to have unprotected sex by examining the role of women’s condom request style. Method: Community, nonproblem-drinking men, ages 21–30 years (N = 296) completed standard alcohol administration procedures and read an eroticized story of a casual sexual interaction. After the woman’s request to use a condom, intentions to engage in coercive CUR tactics were assessed. Generalized linear models with gamma distributions assessed the 3-way interaction of men’s hostility toward women, beverage condition (alcohol or sober), and the woman’s condom request style (indirect, direct, or insistent). Results: The 3-way interaction among hostility toward women, beverage condition, and indirect condom request (vs. direct) significantly predicted men’s coercive CUR intentions. Men high in hostility toward women reported stronger CUR intentions after experiencing an indirect condom request, when sober or intoxicated, and after a direct condom request when intoxicated. Men high in hostility toward women reported the weakest CUR intentions when sober after an insistent or direct condom request. Conclusions: Men high in hostility toward women pose a threat to women’s sexual safety, particularly when intoxicated or after an indirect condom request. Hostility toward women and alcohol consumption should be addressed in sexual risk prevention programs. Pending further replication, women should be informed of the relative effectiveness of using insistent condom requests."

  tags: "LGBT"
  abstract: "This study examined the differences in men’s sexual assault victimization experiences based on their history of only having sex with women (MSW) or having sex with women and men (MSW/M). Based on the previous research, we expected that MSW/M would be more likely to report a sexual assault history, experience a significantly greater number of sexual assault acts, experience more severe levels of unwanted sexual activity and tactics (i.e., physically forced attempted or completed rape), and report both male and female perpetrators, compared with MSW. Community, nonproblem drinking men, ages 21 to 30 (N = 311), reported on their sexual assault victimization experiences since age 14 using a modified version of the Sexual Experiences Survey. Six items were used to assess participants’ number of unwanted sexual experiences (i.e., unwanted sexual contact, attempted and completed rape) that included the use of intoxication, physical force, both, or neither. For each item, participants indicated if the perpetrator(s) was/were male, female, or both male and female. Two fifths of men reported experiencing sexual assault, the majority of which involved attempted or completed rape. Replicating and extending previous research, MSW/M were significantly more likely to be victims (65% vs. 39%), experienced a significantly greater number of sexual assault acts since age 14, were more likely to have experienced attempted or completed rape through the use of physical force, and were more likely to report male only or both male and female perpetrators across their victimization experiences, as compared with MSW. Results indicate a clear need for additional research on the unique victimization experiences of MSW/M. Additionally, sexual assault prevention programming needs to provide men with the skills to identify and negotiate unwanted sexual advances made by men and women and to promote healthy sexual relationship behaviors."

  tags: "aggression, risky behavior, condom use, sexually transmitted infections"
  abstract: "According to the Conﬂuence Model of Sexual Violence, men with a strong impersonal sex orientation (i.e., greater engagement in sexual activities with more casual sexual partners) are at increased risk of perpetrating sexual violence. Research from a variety of countries and samples has supported this proposition, ﬁnding that men who perpetrate sexual violence are also more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. The present article reviews this literature, synthesizing research ﬁndings from both psychology and public health domains utilizing both domestic and international samples. In particular, this review focuses on the associations between men's perpetration of sexual violence and their sexual partners, condom use, and sexually transmitted infection status, as well as provides recommendations for future research directions and prevention and intervention program-ming."

  tags: "aggression"
  abstract: "To provide evidence regarding the construct validity of a sexual aggression proxy in which male participants go on multiple virtual dates with a woman. A unique strength of this proxy is participants’ opportunity to make choices throughout the simulation about how they interact with their virtual date. These decisions determine their exposure to the female agent’s sexual refusals. Method: Piloting included focus groups (n = 82), surveys (n = 95), and cognitive interviews (n = 32). To establish construct validity, 87 male participants completed 2 separate sessions: a) an online survey with measures of discriminant and convergent validity; and b) a lab session in which they went on multiple dates that included nonsexual options, sexual options that the female agent accepted, and sexual options she refused. Sexual aggression was operationalized as the total number of sexual refusals that partici-pants’ received. Results: There was strong correlational evidence for discriminant and convergent validity. As hypothesized, there were some differences in the risk factors associated with refusals received on casual as compared to steady dates. Additionally, the number of refusals received was associated with the types of thoughts and actions commonly reported by perpetrators. Conclusions: This simulation provides a new approach for examining sexual aggression in controlled experiments that vary factors within the simulation such as the man’s and woman’s intoxication and past sexual history. Because what happens is based on each individual’s responses, it could be adapted for use in prevention and treatment programs."

  tags: "culture of honor, rape, interpersonal violence"
  abstract: "Prior research has connected the cultural ideology of honor to intrasexual violence between men and to attitudes supporting intersexual aggression in response to perceived honor violations by female romantic partners. We extend this research to show that honor ideology is also associated with an increased likelihood of men actually engaging in violent and sexually coercive behaviors toward women. Extending previous research on honor-based schemas and scripts linked to relationship violence, comparisons between honor states and non–honor states in the United States show that official rape and domestic homicide rates by White male perpetrators (Study 1) and experiences of rape and violence in relationships anonymously reported by White female teenagers (Study 2) were higher in honor states, controlling for a variety of potential confounds. These results extend prior laboratory research on honor-based schemas and scripts into the realm of extreme, real-world behaviors."

  abstract: "Sexual cyberbullying is a relatively novel issue wherein various forms of technology including cell phone messaging, social media, and other online tools are used to harass another individual in a sexually explicit fashion, or to coerce an individual into providing private sexual information or engage in activities which are sexual in nature. The present article explores the relevant research to date on sexual cyberbullying. A metho-dological critique of this literature is discussed and suggestions for future research are provided. In particular, the importance of establishing a theoretical framework which can be used to better conceptualize and under-stand sexual cyberbullying and other forms of technologically mediated aggression is highlighted. Contextual factors which may also inﬂuence sexual cyberbullying, such as alcohol, hookup culture, and the recent dis-cussion of revenge porn in the media, are also discussed."

  tags: "assertiveness, compliance, consent, decision-making, unwanted sex"
  abstract: "Unwanted sexual encounters include a broad spectrum of behaviors that may include everything from regretted or coerced sex to sexual assault and rape. Sadly, experience with unwanted sex is all too common among college aged women. A number of factors have been examined in the context of sexual interactions in this population including relationship status, sexual want, sexual assertiveness, and sexual consent. However, research to date lacks analyses which consider the potentially interactive nature of the aforementioned variables in sexual decision making. To that end, the present study examined the role of relationship status, sexual want, and sexual assertiveness on self-report consent in a sexual encounter. Female undergraduate students (N = 319) self-reported on their relationship status, as well as their sexual want (desire to engage in sexual activity), sexual assertiveness, and sexual consent behaviors within the context of their most recent sexual experience. A moderated multiple regression was conducted to determine whether sexual assertiveness moderated self-reported sexual want and consent. Relationship status was included as the primary predictor in the aforementioned model. The overall model was significant, indicating an interaction model of sexual decision-making. Generally, women displayed increased sexual consent behavior as sexual want increased across levels of sexual assertiveness, regardless of relationship status. Importantly, women low in sexual assertiveness were high in sexual compliance (i.e. consenting to/engaging in sexual activity even when self-reported sexual want was low)."

  abstract: "Employing a natural language processing approach, we analyzed textual content derived from publicly-available athlete victim impact statements (VIS) from the Larry Nassar trial (n = 111) to examine psychosocial responses to sexual violence. To explore potential differences in a non-sports context, we conducted similar analyses on a sample of #MeToo tweets (n = 45,848). Our research focused on the semantic content of VIS, including positive and negative affect, power and trust dynamics, well-being, and post-traumatic growth. We hypothesized that athletes’ reactions to sexual violence would be more likely to contain language related to power and trust. Traditional null-hypothesis significance testing and network analyses were used to identify the psychosocial indicators unique to sexual violence disclosures in a sports context. Results indicated differential use of language related to negative affect, trust, power dynamics, and post-traumatic growth in sports versus non-sports contexts. We discuss clinical, practical, and policy-based implications for risk reduction and intervention."

  tags: "qualitative, disclosure"
  abstract: "Qualitative interview data from 45 matched pairs of survivors disclosing sexual assaults and their primary informal support providers (e.g., friend, family member, signiﬁcant other) were used to explore survivor and support provider perspectives on changes in sexuality postassault and how those close to them have been affected as a result. Changes in sexuality included loss of interest in sex, increase or change in sexual partners, engaging in sex work, and increased sexual behavior. Support providers generally regarded promiscuity as a risky sexual behavior. If the support provider was the survivor’s sexual partner, he or she discussed exercising caution when navigating sexual intimacy with the survivor. Not all sexual encounters with romantic partners were positive; some survivors discussed being triggered (i.e., with post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] ﬂashbacks) or experiencing the dissolution of their relationships due to the sexual impacts of their assault. Counseling implications are discussed in the context of improv-ing survivors’ sexual experiences in general and in romantic relationships postassault. Implications can also be applied to prevention, scholarship on sex work, and sexuality research."

  tags: "masculinity, rape-related behaviors"
  abstract: "Previous research has found masculine gender roles to predict rape-related behaviors and attitudes, but there is some ambiguity in the literature regarding the mechanisms of these associations. Further, theoretical literature has suggested repeatedly that men's sense of entitlement to women is crucial in understanding rape-related behaviors and attitudes. On the basis of these 2 bodies of literature, we speculated that men's sense of entitlement may be an important 3rd variable partially driving the relations between masculine gender roles and rape-related variables. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the relations among entitlement, rape-related behaviors and attitudes, and masculine gender roles. More specifically, the authors used path analyses to test a conceptual model whereby entitlement mediated the links between masculine gender roles and 4 rape-related variables. Results revealed that men's sense of general and sexual entitlement completely mediated the relations between masculinity and rape-related attitudes and behaviors in 3 of the 4 models and partially in the 4th."

  abstract: "Despite consistent evidence that fraternity membership is associated with greater perpetration and acceptance of sexual violence, less is known about why this link occurs. In this study, we use Structural Equation Modeling to test whether endorsement of traditional masculinity explains why fraternity membership is associated with greater rape myth acceptance and more sexual deception behaviors in a sample of 365 undergraduate men. Our assessment of traditional masculinity included the following 3 components: conformity to masculine norms, pressure to uphold masculine norms, and acceptance of objectification of women. Results suggest that conformity to masculine norms, pressure to uphold masculine norms, and acceptance of objectification of women mediate the relation between fraternity membership and acceptance of sexual violence."

  tags: "bystander, alcohol, research methods"
  abstract: "The bystander approach is a promising strategy for preventing sexual violence (Banyard, 2011; McMahon, 2015; White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, 2014). Because sexual violence often occurs in alcohol-rich contexts (Lawyer et al., 2010; Testa & Cleveland, 2017), it is likely that bystanders to sexual violence will often be under the influence of alcohol. However, little is known about the effects of alcohol intoxication on bystanders to situations involving risk for sexual violence. To explore how naturalistic alcohol intoxication can impact perceptions of sexual assault risk and hypothetical willingness to intervene, our research team, led by one undergraduate student, visited a bar, a music festival, and a football game armed with survey packets and a breathalyzer. Participants (N = 106) read one of two scenarios describing risk for sexual assault and responded to questions assessing perceived risk and willingness to intervene. Next, BAC was measured and recorded. Participants were compensated with food vouchers. The experience taught students about research design, integrity, and ethics. Researchers and participants enjoyed the experience and valuable information was learned. Specifically, perceptions of risks and willingness to intervene were high in both scenarios, and were uncorrelated with BAC. This implies that young adults are able to recognize risk for violence and willing to intervene even when intoxicated."

  tags: "alcohol, bystander, rape myths"
  abstract: "While a negative relationship between rape myth acceptance (RMA) and bystander behavior is established, the specific myths associated with bystander behavior are not well understood. In Study 1, we presented 260 participants with vignettes manipulating clothing and alcohol intake of a woman victim to see how it affected intention to help. In Study 2, we presented 247 participants with similar vignettes, manipulating alcohol intake and relationship with the bystander. Contrary to previous research on RMA, participants were significantly more willing to intervene if the woman was intoxicated. Intervention also depended upon the participants’ relationship to the woman: stranger or acquaintance."
